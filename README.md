An applet I worked on while doing a **`Coursera`**'s Java course **`Data Structures and Performance`**  in 2016. 
 (about the course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance)
(certificate of completion: https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/UMG5PF5B544E)

The course focuses on working with **textual data** using linked lists, trees, and hashtables. It also introduces asymptotic **Big-O analysis** to measure performance.

The skeleton of the app was created by Coursera.  My assignements involved implementing various **methods for a text editor (spelling suggestions, autocompletion, distance between words, Flesch index**, etc.) Details of the assignements are can be found in the pdf files in the root of the project.# Text-Editor
